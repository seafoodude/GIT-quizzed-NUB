## Description

This Homework 4 Codequiz was created for boot camp students who were going through Module 04. It contains a short 60 second 4 question quiz regarding code functions.

My motivation came from my desire to learn Javascript, HTML, and CSS and apply it in creating a small codequiz.
I created this codequiz to show that I have learned and absorbed the information given to me through the Module 04 requirement from the UCLA coding bootcamp.
This helped me to achieve a foothold in building more complex and functional programs in my future projects.
I learned how to build a quiz to display my knowledge and understanding of Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
